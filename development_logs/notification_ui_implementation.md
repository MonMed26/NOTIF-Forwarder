# Notification UI Implementation - December 18, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced the user interface to support both SMS and notification forwarding rules, adding proper permission management and user guidance.

## UI Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AddRuleDialog
**Features Added**:
- Source type selection (SMS vs Notifications) using FilterChips
- Dynamic pattern labels and placeholders based on source type
- Package filter support for notification rules
- Checkbox to enable/disable specific app filtering
- Clear validation logic for notification package requirements
- User-Friendly App Picker: Integrated app search and selection instead of manual package name entry

**User Experience**:
- Users can now create both SMS and notification rules in the same dialog
- Context-sensitive help text and examples
- Intuitive package filtering with "all apps" option

### 2. Updated RulesScreen
**Changes**:
- Changed title from "SMS Forwarding Rules" to "Forwarding Rules"
- Added source type display for each rule (SMS/NOTIFICATION)
- Show package filter information for notification rules
- Color-coded source type and package information
- Updated empty state message to reflect both SMS and notifications

### 3. Enhanced SettingsScreen
**New Permission Management**:
- Added Notification Access permission with special handling
- Direct link to Android's Notification Listener Settings
- Real-time permission status checking
- Proper notification listener service status detection

**Improved Instructions**:
- Separate testing instructions for SMS and notifications
- Color-coded sections for different testing types
- Updated debug tips to include notification logs
- Comprehensive permission requirements explanation

### 4. Fixed Build Configuration
**KAPT Issues Resolved**:
- Moved KAPT configuration outside android block
- Added proper Room schema configuration
- Resolved annotation processor warnings

### 5. App Picker Dialog (New Feature)
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search with 300ms debounce for optimal performance
- **Visual App Display**: Shows app icons, names, and package names for easy identification
- **MRU (Most Recently Used) Cache**: Displays recently used apps first for convenience
- **Usage Stats Integration**: Leverages Android's UsageStatsManager for intelligent app ordering
- **Fallback Support**: Common apps fallback when usage stats unavailable
- **Performance Optimized**: Lazy loading and efficient bitmap handling

#### App Picker Implementation Details:
```kotlin
// Key Features:
- Debounced search (300ms delay)
- MRU apps from UsageStatsManager
- Visual app icons with fallback
- System app indicators
- Real-time search results
- Package name display for clarity
```

### 6. App Search Performance Optimization (New)
- **Comprehensive App Cache**: 5-minute TTL cache for all installed apps
- **Multi-Priority Search Algorithm**: 
  1. Exact name matches (highest priority)
  2. Name starts with query
  3. Name contains query  
  4. Package name contains query (for advanced users)
- **Thread-Safe Caching**: Mutex-protected cache with expiry handling
- **Background Preloading**: Cache loads on app startup for instant search
- **Expanded App Database**: Includes Facebook Messenger, Skype, Teams, TikTok, and 15+ popular apps

#### Performance Improvements:
```kotlin
// Before: Slow, limited search
- No caching - PackageManager called every search
- Only searched MRU apps first
- Missing popular apps like Messenger

// After: Fast, comprehensive search
- 5-minute app cache with background preloading
- Priority-based search algorithm
- Complete app database with 19 popular apps
- Instant results after initial cache load
```

### 7. Android 11+ Package Visibility Solution (Critical Fix)

#### The Problem:
Starting with Android 11 (API 30), Google introduced package visibility restrictions for privacy and security. Apps can no longer see all installed applications by default, which broke our app picker functionality.

#### Our Comprehensive Solution:

**1. Manifest Queries Declaration:**
```xml
<queries>
    <!-- Query for all launcher apps -->
    <intent>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent>
    
    <!-- Query for messaging apps -->
    <intent>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
    </intent>
    
    <!-- Explicit package declarations for 25+ popular apps -->
    <package android:name="com.whatsapp" />
    <package android:name="com.facebook.orca" />
    <!-- ... and 23 more popular apps -->
</queries>
```

**2. Multi-Method App Detection:**
```kotlin
// Method 1: Traditional getInstalledApplications (Android < 11)
val installedApps = packageManager.getInstalledApplications(PackageManager.GET_META_DATA)

// Method 2: Launcher intent query (always visible)
val launcherIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MAIN).apply {
    addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER)
}
val launcherApps = packageManager.queryIntentActivities(launcherIntent, PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY)

// Method 3: Explicit popular app checking
popularApps.forEach { (packageName, fallbackName) ->
    try {
        val appInfo = packageManager.getApplicationInfo(packageName, 0)
        // Add to app list
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // App not installed or not visible
    }
}
```

**3. Fallback Permissions:**
```xml
<!-- For apps that truly need to see all packages (requires Google Play approval) -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />

<!-- For usage statistics and MRU functionality -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS" />
```

**4. Debug and Troubleshooting:**
- Added debug method to test app visibility
- Comprehensive logging for search operations
- Settings screen debug panel (debug builds only)
- Clear user guidance for Android 11+ limitations

#### Technical Implementation Details:
```kotlin
// Three-tier app discovery approach:
1. Try getInstalledApplications() - works on older Android versions
2. Query launcher intents - always available, gets user-visible apps  
3. Check declared popular apps - ensures critical apps are found

// Result: Maximum app coverage across all Android versions
```

#### User Impact:
- ✅ **Messenger now found** when searching "messenger"
- ✅ **All popular apps** (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.) are discoverable
- ✅ **Backwards compatible** with Android < 11
- ✅ **Future-proof** with proper manifest declarations
- ✅ **Debug tools** for troubleshooting issues

## Technical Implementation

### Permission Handling
```kotlin
// Check notification listener status
val isNotificationListenerEnabled = remember(context) {
    NotifRouterService.isServiceEnabled(context)
}

// Open notification settings
val openNotificationListenerSettings = {
    val intent = Intent(Settings.ACTION_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SETTINGS)
    context.startActivity(intent)
}
```

### Rule Creation with Source Types
```kotlin
// Enhanced rule creation with source type and package filtering
val rule = Rule(
    name = name.trim(),
    pattern = pattern.trim(),
    isRegex = isRegex,
    endpoint = endpoint.trim(),
    method = method,
    headers = headersMap,
    isActive = true,
    source = sourceType, // SMS or NOTIFICATION
    packageFilter = if (sourceType == SourceType.NOTIFICATION && usePackageFilter) {
        packageFilter.trim().takeIf { it.isNotBlank() }
    } else null,
    createdAt = now,
    updatedAt = now
)
```

## User Journey Improvements

### Rule Creation Flow
1. **Source Selection**: User chooses SMS or Notification
2. **Pattern Definition**: Context-aware pattern input with examples
3. **Package Filtering**: Optional for notifications, with clear UI feedback
4. **Endpoint Configuration**: Same for both source types
5. **Validation**: Source-specific validation rules

### Permission Setup Flow
1. **SMS Permissions**: Standard Android permission requests
2. **Notification Access**: Direct link to system settings

## Implementation Log

### History Screen Pagination and Delete Functionality (2024-01-XX)

**Features Implemented**:
- **Pagination**: History loads in pages of 15 items instead of loading all at once
- **Visible delete buttons**: Each history item shows a delete button for easy access
- **Delete functionality**: Individual delete and "Clear All" options
- **Load more**: Button to load additional pages when available
- **Improved UI**: Better statistics display and modern Material 3 design

**Technical Details**:

1. **Database Layer Updates**:
   - Added `getHistoryPaginated(limit: Int, offset: Int)` to `HistoryDao`
   - Added `deleteHistoryById(id: Long)` to `HistoryDao`

2. **Repository Layer**:
   - Added `getHistoryPaginated(page: Int, pageSize: Int)` to `HistoryRepository`
   - Added `deleteHistoryById(id: Long)` to `HistoryRepository`

3. **ViewModel Updates**:
   - Implemented pagination logic with `PAGE_SIZE = 15`
   - Added `loadNextPage()`, `refreshHistory()`, `deleteHistoryEntry()`, `clearAllHistory()`
   - Added `isLoadingMore` and `hasMorePages` states
   - Automatic loading of next page when items are deleted and list becomes too short

4. **UI Components**:
   - **Delete buttons**: Each history item displays a delete button with error color
   - **Responsive layout**: Delete button positioned next to status chip
   - **Load more button** with loading state
   - **Refresh and clear all buttons** in top app bar
   - **Confirmation dialog** for "Clear All" action
   - **Simplified detail dialog** focused on viewing information

**User Experience Improvements**:
- **Performance**: Only loads 15 items at a time, reducing memory usage
- **Direct Access**: Delete buttons are immediately visible on each item
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for delete actions with proper error coloring
- **Safety**: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental bulk deletion
- **Responsive**: Loading states provide clear feedback
- **Clean Layout**: Improved spacing and visual hierarchy

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/data/local/dao/HistoryDao.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/data/repository/HistoryRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/ui/screen/history/HistoryViewModel.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/ui/screen/history/HistoryScreen.kt`

**Testing Recommendations**:
- Test pagination with large datasets
- Verify swipe gestures work across different screen sizes
- Test delete functionality doesn't break statistics
- Ensure proper error handling for delete operations

### Statistics Accuracy Fix (2024-01-XX)

**Issue**: The "matched" count in statistics was only showing the count from the current page, not the total matched items in the entire history when pagination was implemented.

**Root Cause**: Statistics were being calculated from the paginated results (`uiState.history.count { it.matchedRule }`) instead of querying the entire database.

**Solution**: 
1. **Database Layer**: Added filtered count queries to `HistoryDao`:
   - `getFilteredMatchedCount()` - Gets total matched count with current filters
   - `getFilteredTotalCount()` - Gets total count with current filters

2. **Repository Layer**: Added `getFilteredStatistics()` method that:
   - Uses regular statistics when no filters are active
   - Uses filtered statistics when filters are applied
   - Returns accurate counts for the entire dataset, not just current page

3. **ViewModel Layer**: 
   - Replaced local counting with database queries
   - Added `loadFilteredStatistics()` method
   - Statistics update automatically when filters change
   - Statistics refresh after delete operations

4. **Statistics Behavior**:
   - **No Filters**: Shows total statistics for entire history
   - **With Filters**: Shows statistics for filtered results only
   - **Matched Count**: Always accurate regardless of pagination
   - **Total Count**: Reflects filtered results when filters are active

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/data/local/dao/HistoryDao.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/data/repository/HistoryRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/zerodev/smsforwarder/ui/screen/history/HistoryViewModel.kt`

**Result**: Statistics now accurately reflect the actual database counts, with proper handling of both filtered and unfiltered views. Users see correct matched counts regardless of how many pages are loaded.
