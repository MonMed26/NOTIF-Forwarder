# SMS Forwarder Android App - Implementation Log

## Date: $(date)

## Architecture Overview
- **Pattern**: Clean Architecture (MVVM + Repository Pattern)
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose with Material 3
- **DI**: Hilt Dependency Injection
- **Database**: Room for local persistence
- **Background**: Foreground Service + WorkManager
- **Networking**: Retrofit2 + OkHttp3

## Key Components

### Core Features
1. **SMS Background Listener** - BroadcastReceiver + ForegroundService
2. **Pattern Matching** - Regex/substring matching against SMS body
3. **HTTP API Forwarding** - Configurable endpoints with custom headers
4. **Rule Management** - CRUD operations for SMS forwarding rules
5. **History Tracking** - Paginated logs of forwarding attempts

### Architecture Layers
- **UI Layer**: Compose screens, ViewModels
- **Domain Layer**: Use cases, business logic
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, Room database, API clients

### Key Design Decisions
1. Target SDK 34 (as requested in requirements)
2. Minimum SDK 29 (Android 10+) for modern SMS handling
3. Foreground service for reliable background operation
4. WorkManager for boot persistence and periodic health checks
5. Coroutines + Flow for reactive programming
6. Room database for local rule and history storage

- [ ] Complete documentation and README

## Completed Components

### Data Layer
- ✅ RuleEntity & HistoryEntity (Room entities)
- ✅ RuleDao & HistoryDao (Database access objects)
- ✅ Type converters for complex types
- ✅ SmsForwarderDatabase (Room database)
- ✅ Entity mappers (Domain ↔ Database)

### Domain Layer
- ✅ Rule, SmsMessage, ForwardingHistory models
- ✅ SmsForwardingUseCase (Main business logic)
- ✅ Pattern matching with regex support
- ✅ Validation logic for rules

### Data Layer (Network & Services)
- ✅ ForwardingApiService (Retrofit interface)
- ✅ HttpClient with retry logic
- ✅ SmsReceiver (BroadcastReceiver)
- ✅ BootReceiver (Auto-start on boot)
- ✅ SmsForwardingService (Foreground service)
- ✅ SmsMonitoringWorker (WorkManager)

### Repositories
- ✅ RuleRepository (Rule CRUD operations)
- ✅ HistoryRepository (History management)

### Dependency Injection
- ✅ DatabaseModule (Room dependencies)
- ✅ NetworkModule (Retrofit/OkHttp dependencies)
- ✅ Application class with Hilt

### Android Configuration
- ✅ AndroidManifest.xml with all permissions
- ✅ Foreground service configuration
- ✅ BroadcastReceiver registration
- ✅ Notification icon drawable

## Technical Considerations
- **Battery Optimization**: Foreground service with minimal notification
- **Android 10+ SMS Restrictions**: Proper permissions and receiver registration
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex support with fallback to substring matching
- **Error Handling**: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- **Threading**: Background SMS processing with main thread UI updates
